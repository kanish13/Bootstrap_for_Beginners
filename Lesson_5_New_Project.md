To learn bootstrap , we are going to start a new project called “Tindog” ( Tinder for dogs ):

Lets not waste time in adding the basic stuffs. So go ahead and the zip file or clone the project from the below github link:

Download the Starting Files

In the coming lessons, we'll be learning about Bootstrap while we build and design our TinDog website.

I've created a skeleton project with all the graphics and some skeleton HTML for you to work with.

1. Head over here:

https://github.com/londonappbrewery/TinDog-Start

2. Click on the Code dropdown then click on Download ZIP

3. Extract the ZIP file and move it to your Desktop.

N.B.Throughout the course, we'll often be using skeleton files to save you time typing out all the HTML and text you see on screen. If you want to have extra practice creating the HTML elements, then simply follow the above steps then double click on the index.html file to see it rendered in the browser then you can use this as a starting point to create your own
